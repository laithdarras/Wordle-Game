# Wordle-Game
This repository contains the source code for a Wordle game developed as a school project. The game is implemented in C++ and allows players to guess a hidden word of any length within a maximum of 6 attempts.

## Description
The Wordle game is a word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating which letters are correct and in the correct position, and which letters are correct but in the wrong position.
